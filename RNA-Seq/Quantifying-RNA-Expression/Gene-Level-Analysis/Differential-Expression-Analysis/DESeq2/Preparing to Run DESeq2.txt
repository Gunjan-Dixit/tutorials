Step 1: Download the files produced by HTSeq-count for each of your samples (this was also the last step of the previous instruction file). Put these files in a working directory on your computer that will be convenient to work in. I am just going to call it: C:\RNASeq\ReadCounts\ 
Go ahead and make additional folders there for our eventual output:
C:\RNASeq\DESeq2Output\
C:\RNASeq\DESeq2DEGenes\
Step 2: Download and install R: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/ 
Step 3: Donwload and install R-Studio: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ 
Step 4: Launch R-Studio. Move to your RNA-Seq directory with the following command:
setwd('C:/RNASeq/')
Note: no, that isn't a typo, R uses forward slashes to separate folders even in Windows
Step 5: Install biocLite (the installation/updating software for bioconductor):
source('http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R')
If you are asked to update all, some, or none of the dependent packages, type 'a' and then hit the 'enter' key to update all of them
Step 6: Install DESeq2
biocLite('DESeq2')
If you are asked to update all, some, or none of the dependent packages, type 'a' and then hit the 'enter' key to update all of them
Step 7: Load DESeq2
library(DESeq2)

Proceed to the simple DESeq2 data analysis script (and its corresponding explanation file). That script covers data analyses where you have three replicates of a control condition and three replicates of an experimental condition. The multi-variate DESeq2 analysis script handles more advanced/complicated setups.
